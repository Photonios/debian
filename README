Goal: create a well-written, stable and working clone of dpkg/apt-get for Windows.

This is very much a work in progress. Nothing is working yet. What I've done so far:

- Implemented parsing version numbers
- Implemented reading a *.deb file
    - Implemented detecting the compression type (for both the `control.tar.gz` and `data` archive)
    - Implemented detecting the archive format (for both the `control.tar.gz` and `data` archive)
    - Implemented opening the `control` archive
    - Implemented reading and parsing the `control` file from the `control.tar.gz` archive
- Added unit tests for parsing version numbers
