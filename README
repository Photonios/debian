Goal
---------------------------------------------------------
    Create a well-written, stable and working clone of dpkg/apt-get for Windows.
    
Work in progress
---------------------------------------------------------
    This is very much a work in progress. Nothing is working yet. What I've done so far:
    
    - Implemented parsing version numbers
    - Implemented reading a *.deb file
        - Implemented detecting the compression type for archives
        - Implemented detecting the archive format for archives
        - Implemented opening the `control` archive
        - Implemented reading and parsing the `control` file
    - Added unit tests for parsing version numbers

Dependencies
---------------------------------------------------------
These dependencies are currently included:

    - libarchive
    - liblzma
    - zlib
    - glib
    - google-test
    
Building
---------------------------------------------------------
    Provided you have Visual Studio 2013 everything should build out-of-the-box by just opening
    the Visual Studio solution file.
    
Architecture
---------------------------------------------------------
    The whole thing (for now) has been split into two
    libraries:
    
        - libdeb
        - libdpkg
        
    The first one will contain functionality for reading
    from and to *.deb archives. This way it can be
    re-used in other applications and/or utilitlies.
    
    The second one will contain everything that dpkg
    does, from installing, upgrading, removing. This
    way the actual dpkg program will stay really small
    and will do nothing more than just parsing command
    line arguments and invoking libdpkg.
